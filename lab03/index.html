            <h2>Reflection on CSS Basics</h2>
            <p>In this lab, I really got to see how CSS can make a big difference in how a webpage looks by keeping the design separate from the content. Before this, I didn’t fully appreciate just how much control CSS gives you over things like layout, colors, and fonts. One of the most helpful things I picked up was learning how to use classes and IDs to apply different styles to elements. It’s also made me think more about web accessibility and how crucial it is to have consistent styling for a better user experience. As I worked through this lab, I found myself experimenting with different color schemes and fonts, which got me even more interested in learning more about design.</p>
            <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How to link an external stylesheet to an HTML document</li>
                <li>The importance of separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Learned how to apply CSS properties to headings and paragraphs</li>
                <li>Gained experience in using class and ID selectors for specific styling</li>
            </ol>
