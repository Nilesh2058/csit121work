        <h1>Website Evaluation - Cricket Association of Nepal</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. URL of the Website:</h2>
        <p><a href="https://cricketnepal.org.np/" target="_blank">https://cricketnepal.org.np/</a></p>

        <h2>2. Name of the Website:</h2>
        <p>Cricket Association of Nepal</p>

        <h2>3. Target Audience:</h2>
        <p>The website primarily targets cricket fans, players, and stakeholders in Nepal. It also attracts international cricket enthusiasts interested in Nepali cricket updates.</p>

        <h2>4. How is the Site Organized?</h2>
        <p>The site is organized with a top navigation bar, including sections like News, Events, Teams, Fixtures, and Contact. The homepage features the latest news articles, match updates, and recent statistics. The footer provides quick links and social media handles.</p>

        <h2>5. CRAP Design Principles Used:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses dark text on a light background for most content areas, enhancing readability. However, some text areas could benefit from improved contrast.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is consistent use of fonts, colors, and layout, maintaining a uniform design across all pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most content is well-aligned, especially in the header and footer, though some homepage elements feel a bit cluttered.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items like news articles and fixtures are grouped logically, aiding in quick navigation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Audit Score According to Accessibility Checker:</h2>
        <p>Audit Score: <strong>75</strong></p>
        <p>There are two critical accessibility issues found:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incorrect heading order</strong>: This affects users with disabilities such as visual or mobility impairments, as screen readers may not interpret the page structure correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Links without discernible text</strong>: This issue hinders users who rely on screen readers, as links without proper descriptions are unclear and difficult to navigate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Site Effectiveness:</h2>
        <p>The site is fairly effective at delivering cricket-related news and updates, but it could be improved by fixing the accessibility issues. Ensuring that headings and links are accessible will help users achieve their goals more effectively.</p>

        <h2>8. Site Efficiency:</h2>
        <p>While users can find information relatively quickly through the main navigation, the site's efficiency could be enhanced by improving the accessibility of links and headings. This would make tasks like reading news or finding fixtures faster.</p>

        <h2>9. Engagement:</h2>
        <p>The website is visually appealing and features engaging content like news, match schedules, and player stats. However, adding more interactive elements (such as live scores or match highlights) could further improve user engagement.</p>

        <h2>10. Recommendation for Improvement:</h2>
        <p>My primary recommendation is to fix the heading structure to ensure that it follows a logical order (e.g., <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>). Additionally, all links should have clear and descriptive text for better accessibility.</p>
