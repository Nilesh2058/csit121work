        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This semester has truly been a transformative experience for me. Before diving into web development, I had little exposure to coding and web technologies. But as I went through the course, I was able to build a solid foundation, gaining a set of skills that have drastically changed the way I approach web development.</p>
        <p>One of the most challenging parts of the course was making my websites responsive. At first, I didn't realize how crucial it was to ensure that a website would look good on all devices. But through learning <b>Flexbox</b> and <b>Grid</b>, I was able to design layouts that adapt to various screen sizes. It took some trial and error, but testing my websites on different devices and using media queries really helped me understand how to create a seamless experience for all users, no matter their device.</p>
        <p>Another hurdle I faced was getting comfortable with <b>JavaScript</b>. When I first started working with the <b>DOM</b> and event handling, I found it tricky to get things to work the way I envisioned. But with practice, experimenting with interactive elements, and pushing through the frustrations, I eventually gained confidence in building dynamic features. Learning how to validate forms and work with APIs expanded my skills even further, and now I feel much more confident about creating interactive web pages.</p>
        <p>Alongside coding, I've also grown in my understanding of <b>UI/UX Design</b>. I've learned that creating a website is not just about making it functional; it's about creating something intuitive and easy to use. From ensuring accessibility to keeping the design clean and simple, I've realized how much thought goes into making a user's experience seamless.</p>
        <p>Looking back, I can confidently say that this course has equipped me with the tools I need to succeed in web development. I'm excited to keep building on these skills, creating fully responsive and dynamic websites and applications. As I continue my studies and move forward in my career, the skills I've learned this semester will definitely be invaluable.</p>
