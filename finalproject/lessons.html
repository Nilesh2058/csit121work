        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>This project has allowed me to consolidate all the knowledge I've gained this semester. I learned to build a responsive, cohesive website while ensuring accessibility and cross-browser compatibility. Testing the site on multiple browsers and devices taught me the importance of browser standards and responsive design.</p>
        <p>Throughout the course, I've grown significantly in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Working with external libraries, using media queries for responsive layouts, and integrating different elements like tables and lists has been a rewarding challenge. Moving forward, I'm confident in applying these skills to future projects.</p>
