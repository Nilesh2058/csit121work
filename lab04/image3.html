        <p>South Africa clinched a thrilling one-run victory over Nepal in the 2024 T20 World Cup. Spinner Tabraiz Shamsi's four-wicket haul played a key role, and a last-ball run-out secured South Africa's win as they defended 115/7. Nepal needed two runs from the final ball, but Gulsan Jha was run out by Heinrich Klaasen. Despite Nepal's strong chase, South Africa's defense and Shamsi's performance earned them a narrow win, keeping their unbeaten record intact.</p>
