            <h2>Reflection on HTML Basics</h2>
            <p>I’ve learned how to properly structure a webpage using HTML. I now understand how different HTML elements work together to create a well-organized page, and how using semantic tags makes the content more meaningful. This really helped me see how HTML is the foundation of every webpage and why it's so important for both structure and accessibility.</p>
            <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
            <ul>

            <h2>Reflection on CSS Basics</h2>
            <p>In this lab, I really got to see how CSS can make a big difference in how a webpage looks by keeping the design separate from the content. Before this, I didn’t fully appreciate just how much control CSS gives you over things like layout, colors, and fonts. One of the most helpful things I picked up was learning how to use classes and IDs to apply different styles to elements. It’s also made me think more about web accessibility and how crucial it is to have consistent styling for a better user experience. As I worked through this lab, I found myself experimenting with different color schemes and fonts, which got me even more interested in learning more about design.</p>
            <p class="highlight">This is an example of ID selector.</p>
            <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How to link an external stylesheet to an HTML document</li>
                <li>The importance of separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Learned how to apply CSS properties to headings and paragraphs</li>
                <li>Gained experience in using class and ID selectors for specific styling</li>
            </ol>

                <h2>Best Design Practices</h2>
                <p>One key lesson I've gained in web design is the significance of creating responsive and accessible websites. By incorporating a single-column design for mobiles and a multi-column design for desktops, I was able to observe how a carefully constructed webpage can offer a smooth user experience on various devices. By utilizing CSS media queries and Flexbox/Grid, I was able to adjust the layout according to screen size, guaranteeing the content stays user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. This encounter emphasized the importance of creating with the user as the central focus, placing emphasis on readability, easy navigation, and keeping the design simple. Responsive design not just improves user experience but also guarantees websites remain pertinent in a society where mobile accessibility is more crucial.</p>
