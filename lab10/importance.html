        <h2>Why CSP Level 2 Matters</h2>
        <p>CSP Level 2 is crucial for ensuring that web applications are safe from malicious attacks. By restricting what content can be loaded and executed by the browser, developers can significantly reduce the surface area for attacks like XSS and data injection. These attacks are commonly exploited to steal sensitive data or manipulate the behavior of a website.</p>
        <p>As web technologies evolve, so do the methods attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities. CSP Level 2 provides web developers with a proactive way to enhance security while maintaining the flexibility needed for modern web applications.</p>
        <p>Implementing CSP is an essential step in securing user data and trust, especially for e-commerce, banking, and other sites dealing with sensitive information.</p>
