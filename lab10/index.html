        <h2>What is Content Security Policy Level 2?</h2>
        <p>Content Security Policy (CSP) Level 2 is a web security standard developed to help protect websites from common threats like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and code injections. It works by allowing website owners to set specific rules for which resources, such as scripts, styles, and images, can be loaded on their site. These rules are defined in HTTP headers, acting as a protective shield against harmful or unauthorized content. Essentially, CSP Level 2 empowers developers to limit what can run on their websites, minimizing the chances of malicious attacks.</p>
        <p>In todayâ€™s world, where cyberattacks are more frequent and sophisticated, CSP Level 2 plays a crucial role in enhancing website security. By implementing it, developers can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches that can compromise sensitive user data or site functionality. This not only makes websites safer but also helps build user trust, ensuring that visitors have a more secure and protected experience while browsing.</p>
